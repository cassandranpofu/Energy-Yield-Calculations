Estimated Specific yield calculation for Germany and Italy
This repository contains Python scripts for estimating the energy yield of floating photovoltaics (FPVs) in Germany and Italy. 
The scripts utilize linear regression models to predict energy yields based on solar irradiance data.
The models are applied to different orientations of FPVs, including south, east, and west facing.
How to run the code?
To run these scripts, ensure you have Python installed along with the following dependencies:

pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib (for plotting)
The scripts can be executed in a Jupyter Notebook environment or as standalone Python scripts.

Data
The calculations rely on specific irradiance and energy yield data, which are loaded from CSV files. 
Sample data is included in the repository for demonstration purposes.

Output
The scripts output CSV files with the estimated energy yields for the respective orientations and conditions.
